    "I can barely see a speckle pattern, but it is there... Does this amount of counts make sense? Lets think of the previous experiment, where we sent only 5 modes (discarded the rest), and had strong diagonal correlations at the end. Since we stayed in the 5-mode subspace pretty well, I think the 5/25 modes difference shouldn't make a difference to the expected amount of single counts. In practice I actually had more single counts in that experiemtn (7000-8000) compared to now (3000-4000). This actually makes sense, since the 5 spots went to five spots, but here the 25 spots also fill the gaps between the spots, so it makes sense that it will lower ~2X the counts, since we fill ~2X space. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the correlations: the strongest correlation on the diagonal was ~5-10 counts/s. Assuming the correlations were perfect, out of the 8000 single counts on D1, we had 5-10 clicks on D2. Now we have half on D1, so we should expect 2-5 clicks on D2. But these are now smeared all over the speckle pattern. Considering a speckle grain is ~100um the whole mask has ~20X20 grains. We don't fill the whole mask etc., say 10X10, so we would expect mean counts of 0.02-0.05. Indeed we get mean counts of ~0.05, and the same std, as expected from a speckle pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total number of coins here is a bit tricky, since we scan here 50um with a 100um fiber. I am pretty sure it translates to a 4X effect. The mean should not be affected at all, and I think that also the std shouldn't: Say I took 4 different scans, each one of them is now fair, and will have some std. I just take them all together! The sum of real counts divided by 4 gives ~8, which is a bit higher than the expected 2-5. "
